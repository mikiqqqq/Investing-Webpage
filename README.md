## SUMMARY:
Plain old (but modern-looking!) website made with vanilla CSS and Javascript.

Home page displays an introduction and 5 basic steps to get started in investing. You can navigate to each step and each type of investment. The sidebar exhibits the steps and a slider of the latest news.

Contact page has a contact form, frames with the "organisation's" locations and send an e-mail button.

About us page just showcases more about "us" and includes socials.

News page displays the top, latest and other news which you can filter based on investing category.

The website is responsive and displays well on all devices. The loading time is quite fast, around one second.

## OVERVIEW:
